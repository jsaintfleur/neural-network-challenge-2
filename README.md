### Feature Engineering  
- Incorporate additional HR metrics such as employee satisfaction surveys and salary growth.  
- Introduce external factors such as industry trends and economic conditions.  

### Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Optimize neural network architecture (e.g., number of layers, neurons, activation functions).  
- Experiment with different optimizers and learning rates.  

### Class Imbalance Handling  
- If attrition cases are underrepresented, use techniques like **SMOTE** or **class weighting**.  

### Model Interpretability  
- Implement **SHAP values** to explain model predictions to HR teams.
