# Employee Retention & Department Optimization Model  

## Project Overview  
This project leverages **deep learning** to enhance HR decision-making by predicting:  

1. **Employee Retention Risk** – Identifying employees who may be at risk of leaving.  
2. **Optimal Department Fit** – Recommending the best department based on employee attributes.  

The solution utilizes a **branched neural network**, allowing for efficient multi-task learning and improved predictive accuracy.  

## Business Impact  
✔️ **Proactive Retention Strategies** – Enables HR teams to take early action on high-risk employees.  
✔️ **Data-Driven Department Placement** – Helps optimize workforce allocation based on skills and suitability.  
✔️ **Efficiency & Scalability** – AI-driven insights reduce manual assessment efforts.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Model Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
